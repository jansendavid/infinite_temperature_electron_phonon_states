# infinite_temperature_electron_phonon_states
This repository contains files to generate the infinite-temperature purification electron-phonon matrix-product states for the Holstein model
at arbitrary filling and the Holstein-Hubbard bipolaron. The code is based on C++ version of the tensor-network library 
[ITensor](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor). Parts of this repository served as the basis for the computations done in 
[Phys. Rev. B 102, 165155](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.102.165155) and
[Phys. Rev. B 106, 155129 ](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.155129) (can also be found on the arXiv).
